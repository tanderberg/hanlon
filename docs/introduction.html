<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
<a href="http://simplicial.net/hanlon/" target="_blank">HaNLON</a> (named after the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor" target="_blank">eponymous razor</a>;
officially short for Hamiltonian Non-Linear Open Numerics) is a package of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" target="_blank">C++</a> libraries and 
programs created to study the dynamics of the standard model of electroweak interactions 
in the low energy, long distance limit. The derivation and physical interpretation of the 
effective Lagrangian upon which it is based are discussed in 
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3187" target="_blank">arXiv:0711.3187</a> and, more at 
length, in 
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.2284" target="_blank">arXiv:0804.2284</a>.

HaNLON's core components are lattice and stencil objects. Specialized programs built on this 
common core are used to seed initial field configurations, relax and optimize them, convert 
them from polar to Cartesian coordinates, evolve them in time, and analyze the results. Field 
data is passed between the different programs using 
<a href="http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Writing_VTK_files_using_python#.22legacy.22" target="_blank">legacy ASCII VTK</a>
format files for portability, ease of inspection (any text editor capable of handling large 
text files will do) and visualization (using e.g. <a href="http://www.paraview.org/" target="_blank">ParaView</a> 
or <a href="https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/" target="_blank">VisIt</a>).
</p>
<p>
All HaNLON programs run from the command line and should require little effort to build and 
use on common computing platforms (*nix, Windows, Mac). Build scripts for the standard 
GNU/Linux C++ toolchain are included in the source distribution.
