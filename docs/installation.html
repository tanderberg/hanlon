<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>
<p>
Since you are reading this, I will assume that you have already, 
<a href="https://github.com/tanderberg/HaNLON/downloads" target="_blank">downloaded</a>
the distribution archive and unpacked it to a new directory.
</p>
For definiteness, I will also assume that you are on a Linux system 
(<a href="http://www.opensuse.org/en/" target="_blank">openSUSE</a> is a great choice) and that you 
unpacked the archive to <strong>hanlon</strong> in your home directory. I will further take for granted that 
you know your way around the 
<a href="http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/cli.html" target="_blank">Linux command line</a> and are
capable of working around minor problems like needing to 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod#Command_line_examples" target="_blank">set execution permissions</a>. 
So,
</p>
<pre class="console">
~> <span class="user">ls hanlon</span>
<strong>bin</strong>  <strong>docs</strong>  license.txt  <strong>source</strong>
~> 
</pre>
<p>
Under <strong>source</strong>, you should find the following directories:
<dl>
   <dt>seed</dt>
      <dd>Creates random fiekd configurations.</dd>
   <dt>relax</dt>
      <dd>Reduces local energy density by selective low pass filtering.</dd>
   <dt>optimize</dt>
      <dd>Minimizes local energy density.</dd>
   <dt>p2c</dt>
      <dd>Converts static configurations from polar to Cartesian scalar field coordinates.</dd>
   <dt>evolve</dt>
      <dd>Computes time evolution of the fields in Minkowski spacetime.</a>
   <dt>evolve_frw</dt>
      <dd>Computes time evolution ofthe fields on the FRW metric.</a>
   <dt>analyze</dt>
      <dd>Analyzes field configurations produced by <strong>evolve</strong>.</dd>
   <dt>analyze_frw</dt>
      <dd>Analyzes field configurations produced by <strong>evolve_frw</strong>.</dd>
   <dt>core</dt>
      <dd>Common code used throughout HaNLON.</dd>
</dl>
Each directory except <strong>core</strong> also has a similarly named "_1d" counterpart: <strong>seed_1d</strong>, 
<strong>relax_1d</strong> and so on. These contain equivalent implementations in 1+1 spacetime (one time and 
one spatial dimension). They were originally written to simulate the evolution of ideal (infinite, 
plane) domain boundary configurations, but they are also very convenient for familiarizing yourself 
with the code and its use. The discretized equations are much simpler in 1D, so these programs are 
shorter, compile and run faster, and produce smaller data files than their 3D equivalents.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>source</strong> directory also contains two shell scripts, "mk_1d" and "mk", which you can use to 
build all 1D and 3D executables with GNU C++ (on a Linux system with all required development packages
installed). They simply launch the "mk" script in each program's subdirectory, which creates the 
corresponding binary in <strong>hanlon/bin</strong>. Let's build all 1D programs:
</p>
<pre class="console">
~> <span class="user">cd hanlon/source</span>
~/hanlon/source> <span class="user">mk_1d</span>
Building seed_1d
Building relax_1d
Building optimize_1d
Building p2c_1d
Building evolve_1d
Building evolve_frw_1d
Building analyze_1d
Building analyze_frw_1d
~/hanlon/source> <span class="user">ls ../bin</span>
analyze_frw_1d  optimize_1d  seed_1d  analyze_1d  evolve_frw_1d
relax_1d        evolve_1d    p2c_1d 
~/hanlon/source> 
</pre>
<p>
This should only take a few seconds. Building the 3D programs takes longer, especially if you decide to use 
Intel's <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-compilers/" target="_blank">optimizing C++ compiler</a> 
(recommended for Intel CPUs).
