<h1>evolve_frw_1d</h1>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
Reads a <a href="http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Writing_VTK_files_using_python#.22legacy.22" target="_blank">legacy ASCII VTK</a> 
file containing a field configuration in one spatial dimension, evolves it on the spatially flat 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann-Lema%C3%AEtre-Robertson-Walker_metric" target="_blank">FRW metric</a>
reduced to 1+1D and saves snapshots of the evolving field configurations to new VTK files at regular conformal time intervals. 
Scalars are read and written in Cartesian field coordinates.

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
Input (-if) and output filenames (-of) should require no explanation. The title (-ot) is just a string 
which ends up in the header of the output file, and might be useful for tagging it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: The title header is also used to store time, FRW scale factor and energy densities of 
radiation, dust and vacuum in a form expected by <a href="analyze_frw.html">analyze_frw</a>. -ot lines 
which resemble this automatically created part of the header will confuse analyze_frw.
</p>
<p>
The roles of -mt (max conformal time), -ms (max number of time steps), -sp (conformal time between sucessive 
snapshot files) and -rp (conformal time between reports to standard output) should also be clear. Keep in mind
that time is conformal, so time steps in linear (ordinary) time become shorter for smaller metric scale factors. 
Also note that -mt and -ms have overlapping functionality; one or the other may be more convenient, depending 
on circumstances.
</p>
<p>
<strong>WARNING:</strong> with the default -mt and -ms, the simulation will run until you 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_(command)" target="_blank">kill</a> it.
</p>
<p>
Unlike its <a href="evolve_1d.html">static spacetime equivalent</a>, evolve_frw_1d does not have a time step 
argument. Instead, you use the -da argument to specify the initial relative change in the FRW scale factor a(t) (i.e. da/a).
This (along with the initial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law" target="_blank">Hubble parameter</a>, 
-h0) is turned into a fixed conformal time step using the first 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations#The_equations" target="_blank">Friedmann equation</a>.
Both conformal time (starting from the arbitrary -t0, which should be left = 0 unless there is some good reason
not to) and physical time (in seconds) are reported to standard output, along with scale factor and energy
densities.
</p>
<p>
The initial scale factor is obtained from the requirement that total energy density equal critical energy density
(which is computed from -h0). Total energy density is computed from -os, the fraction contributed by the simulated 
fields. The rest is made up of dust matter (-od) and vacuum energy (-ov), with radiation implicitly chosen so as to 
make the total <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations#Density_parameter" target="_blank">density parameter</a>
= 1.
</p>
<p>
The metric scale factor a(t) is advanced by simple 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_Euler_method" target="_blank">forward Euler integration</a>, which is 
not as bad as it may seem given the small conformal time steps corresponding to scales of cosmological interest.
The time step factor (-df) multiplies the conformal time step in the a(t) integrator (and nowhere else). It should
normally be left = 1. Its most obvious use is for testing that field evolution does not diverge and that energy 
remains conserved in the static limit -df 0.
</p>
<p>
Lambda (-la) is essentially the strength of the constraint imposed on the scalars to keep their norm = 1. 
Ideally, it should be infinite. In practice, larger -la requires shorter time steps to keep the jitters 
around the constraint surface from diverging, so there is a tradeoff between constraint quality and
runtime. The default value (1000) seems to be a good compromise for many cases of interest. Internally, 
-la is divided by the FRW scale factor a(t) in order to keep it from completely dominating the dynamics.
</p>
<p>
Epsilon (-eo) is essentially the largest acceptable relative change in any field value at any lattice site
between successive iterations of the non-linear solver at the core of the program's Störmer-Verlet integrator.
If this value is exceeded at any lattice site, the solver goes through another iteration for all lattice sites.
This continues until there is convergence or the maximum number of allowed iterations (-mi) is exceeded. In the 
latter case, cascading divergences are likely to ensue, along with rapid deviations from energy conservation,
and the simulation can no longer be trusted. Increasing -mi may help in some cases, but usually only a smaller
time step will.
</p>
<p>
The -eo and -mi arguments are only recognized and used when the program is compiled with the default Störmer-Verlet 
integrator. Euler and fourth order Runge-Kutta integrators are also implemented in the source code, and the program 
can be compiled to use those instead. Euler integration should not be considered for production runs, but may be
useful for pedagogical and testing purposes. Runge-Kutta integration might be competitive with Störmer-Verlet in
some cases.

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>
<dl>
   <dt class="example">evolve_frw_1d</dt>
      <dd class="example">Use the defaults for all argument values. <strong>WARNING:</strong> This will cause the program 
                          to run until you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_(command)" target="_blank">kill</a> it.</dd>
   <dt class="example">evolve_frw_1d -if two_cells -of evolved_two_cells</dt>
      <dd class="example">Read initial configuration from file "two_cells.vtk", write snapshots to files 
                          named "evolved_two_cells_N.vtk", where N is the simulation step number. Again, run until killed.</dd>
   <dt class="example">evolve_frw_1d -h0 3e4 -od 0.5 -ov 0 -os 1e-35 -da 1e-5 -sp 2000</dt>
      <dd class="example">Start the simulation in an early universe expanding at 30000 km/s/Mpc, with 50% of its energy in dust,
                          no vacuum energy, a tiny fraction (1e-35) in the simulated fields, and the rest in radiation. Set the initial
                          fractional scale factor step to 1e-5 and write a report to standard output every 2000 time steps.</dd>
