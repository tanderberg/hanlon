Remove "_1d" everywhere for 3D equivalents. Look under <strong>hanlon/docs</strong> for details.

<h3>Long version</h3>
<p>
It is good housekeeping to store data and executables separately, so let's start by creating a new directory 
for our data files:
</p>
<pre class="console">
~/hanlon/source> <span class="user">cd ..</span>
~/hanlon> <span class="user">mkdir test_1d</span>
~/hanlon> <span class="user">cd test_1d</span>
~/hanlon/test_1d> 
</pre>
<p>
Now we need a seed configuration. All HaNLON programs use (more or less) reasonable default settings, so we could
simply run seed_1d without arguments, but it is more instructive to look at the available options. To see those, 
just present the program with a command line argument which it does not understand, like a lone question mark:
</p>
<pre class="console">
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">../bin/seed_1d ?</span>
Unrecognized command line argument: ?

Supported options [defaults in square brackets]:

Random seed (long integer):                           -rs [0]

Filename for initial data output:                     -of ["initial"]
Title of initial data file:                           -ot ["Initial"]

Operating mode (0 = cells, 1 = pulses, 2 = periodic): -om [0]
Number of lattice sites (2 to 8196):                  -ns [1024]
Number of control points:                             -nc [10]
Boundary width (lattice units):                       -bw [20]
Initial A factor:                                     -af [1]
Periods along x axis (mode 2):                        -nx [1]
</pre>
<p>
For more information, look in the <strong>hanlon/docs</strong> directory, where you should find an html file for each 
HaNLON program. If you are using <a href="http://www.kde.org/" target="_blank">KDE</a>, you can open the page 
about seed_1d from the command line with kde-open:
</p>
<pre class="console">
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">kde-open ../docs/seed_1d.html</span>
~/hanlon/test_1d> 
</pre>
<p>
Or you can be lazy like me and just click icons in your 
<a href="http://www.kde.org/applications/system/dolphin/" target="_blank">favorite file manager</a>.
</p>
<p>
Let's create a simple configuration consisting of just two cells separated by two interpolation 
layers (not one; due to the periodic boundary conditions, the 1D lattice has the topology of a ring):
</p>
<pre class="console">
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">../bin/seed_1d -nc 2 -of two_cells</span>
nSide: 1024
Initializing random number generator.
Generating initial data.
Saving initial data to "two_cells.vtk".
Done saving.
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">ls</span>
two_cells.vtk
</pre>
<p>
You can inspect the file "two_cells.vtk" with any text editor.
</p>
<p>
Once created, the initial configuration needs to be relaxed, so we ask relax_1d how it works:
</p>
<pre class="console">
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">../bin/relax_1d ?</span>
Unrecognized command line argument: ?

Supported options [defaults in square brackets]:

Filename for signal file:                -sf ["signal.txt"]
Filename for initial data output:        -if ["initial"]
Filename for relaxed data output:        -of ["relaxed"]

Title of relaxed data file:              -ot ["Relaxed"]

Number of sweeps between rho checks:     -ns [10]

Relative rho tolerance:                  -rr [1e-06]
Central weight step tolerance threshold: -wt [0.0001]
Central weight step:                     -ws [0.01]
</pre>
<p>
The defaults are fine except for the input filename (see relax_1d.html in <strong>hanlon/docs</strong> for
details). Staying with the "two_cells" root, we can say
</p>
<pre class="console">
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">../bin/relax_1d -if two_cells -of two_cells_relaxed > relax_two_cells.txt</span>
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">ls</span>
relax_two_cells.txt  two_cells_relaxed.vtk  two_cells.vtk
</pre>
<p>
Note that I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redirection_(computing)" target="_blank">redirected</a> 
standard output to the log file "relax_two_cells.txt". This is convenient when dealing with larger jobs, which are 
best executed in the background (and preferably with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup" target="_blank">nohup</a>, 
so you don't inadvertently kill them by closing the console which you launched them from). 
</p>
<p>
By now you get the drift (hint: the listing of program folders in the Setup section above is sorted by 
order of execution). After relaxation comes optimization:
</p>
<pre class="console">
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">../bin/optimize_1d ?</span>
Unrecognized command line argument: ?

Supported options [defaults in square brackets]:

Filename for signal file:                -sf ["signal.txt"]
Filename for initial data input:         -if ["relaxed"]
Filename for minimized data output:      -of ["optimized"]

Title of minimized data file:            -ot ["Optimized"]

Max number of optimizer iterations:      -mi [1000]
Step size:                               -ss [0.1]
Absolute rho tolerance (local):          -at [0.001]
Absolute rho gradient tolerance (local): -gt [1e-06]
Relative rho tolerance (global):         -rr [0.0001]
</pre>
<p>
Again, all we need to change is the filenames:
</p>
<pre class="console">
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">../bin/optimize_1d -if two_cells_relaxed -of two_cells_optimized > optimize_two_cells.txt</span>
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">ls</span>
optimize_two_cells.txt  two_cells_optimized.vtk  two_cells.vtk
relax_two_cells.txt     two_cells_relaxed.vtk
</pre>
<p>
All VTK files created up to this point use polar coordinates for the scalar field components.
Time evolution is computed using Cartesian field coordinates, so we need to change coordinates 
using p2c_1d first:
</p>
<pre class="console">
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">../bin/p2c_1d ?</span>
Unrecognized command line argument: ?

Supported options [defaults in square brackets]:

Input filename:  -if ["optimized"]
Output filename: -of ["cartesian"]
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">../bin/p2c_1d -if two_cells_optimized -of two_cells_cartesian</span>
Reading input file "two_cells_optimized.vtk"
Done loading.
nSide: 1024
Writing output file "two_cells_cartesian.vtk"
</pre>
<p>
This is not done automatically by optimize_1d because you may occasionally want to skip optimization, or 
relaxation, or both. In principle, nothing prevents you from feeding any of the VTK files created so far 
to p2c_1d and then evolve its output.
</p>
<p>
We are finally ready for the main course: time evolution. We can evolve the fields in Minkowski spacetime 
(evolve_1d) or on the FRW metric (evolve_frw_1d). Let's take the easier route:
</p>
<pre class="console">
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">../bin/evolve_1d ?</span>
Unrecognized command line argument: ?

Supported options [defaults in square brackets]:

Filename for initial data input:        -if ["cartesian"]
Filename for evolved data output:       -of ["evolved"]
Title of evolved data file:             -ot ["Evolved"]

Time step (lattice units):              -dt [0.0001]
Lambda (potential constant):            -la [1000]
Epsilon (negligible error):             -eo [1e-06]
Max iterations in solver:               -mi [100]

Max simulated time (lattice units):     -mt [-1]
Max number of time steps:               -ms [-1]
Save period (lattice units):            -sp [1]
Report period (lattice units):          -rp [0]
</pre>
<p>
As usual, we need to provide filenames, but for demonstration purposes it is also convenient to limit the 
total simulated time (-mt) and to increase the report period (-rp). With the default values, the simulation 
will run until you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_(command)" target="_blank">kill</a> it, and a 
line will be written to standard output for each time step. With the following arguments, the fields will be 
evolved for two lattice time units and progress will be reported at intervals of 0.1 lattice time units:
</p>
<pre class="console">
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">../bin/evolve_1d -rp 0.1 -mt 2 -if two_cells_cartesian -of -of two_cells_evolved > evolve_two_cells.txt</span>
~/hanlon/test_1d> 
</pre>
<p>
Since we did not change the default -sp argument, field values are saved at intervals of one lattice time 
unit. We end up with three new VTK files rather than two because lattice time after 20000 steps is rounded 
to 1.9999999999998, so one more step is taken before the time limit imposed by -mt is reached, at which
point the program saves the final simulation state:
</p>
<pre class="console">
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">ls two_cells_evolved_*.vtk</span>
two_cells_evolved_10000.vtk  two_cells_evolved_20000.vtk  two_cells_evolved_20001.vtk
~/hanlon/test_1d> 
</pre>
<p>
The filenames end with the number of the simulation step at which the files were created.
</p>
These files contain raw field values, which are not terribly enlightening on their own. To extract observables,
we need to run analyze_1d:
<pre class="console">
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">../bin/analyze_1d ?</span>
Unrecognized command line argument: ?

Supported options [defaults in square brackets]:

Input filename:                      -if ["raw"]
Output directory:                    -od [""]

Lambda (potential constant):         -la [1000]
Analysis level [0..2]:               -al [0]
</pre>
<p>
Unlike all HaNLON programs we have seen so far, analyze_1d creates a new directory (named after the input file 
unless a different name is specified with -od) and creates multiple output files there: VTK files containing 
observable values over the entire simulation space and text files with summaries. The number of files created 
is larger for higher analysis levels (-al). Be forewarned that -al 2 can be extremely time-consuming.
</p>
<p>
Typically, you will want to analyze all VTK files created by a simulation run. This is most easily done with a 
shell loop:
</p>
<pre class="console">
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">for f in two_cells_evolved_*.vtk; do ../bin/analyze_1d -if ${f%\.*} >> analyze_two_cells.txt; done</span>
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">ls -d */</span>
<strong>two_cells_evolved_10000/</strong>  <strong>two_cells_evolved_20000/</strong>  <strong>two_cells_evolved_20001/</strong>
~/hanlon/test_1d> <span class="user">ls two_cells_evolved_10000</span>
averages.txt  divE.vtk  m_mid.vtk    p_theta.vtk  rho_E.vtk       rho.vtk
A.vtk         E.vtk     p_B.vtk      p.vtk        rho_lambda.vtk  theta.vtk
B.vtk         m_hi.vtk  p_E.vtk      q.vtk        rho_mixed.vtk   w.vtk
divEMq.vtk    m_lo.vtk  p_mixed.vtk  rho_B.vtk    rho_theta.vtk
</pre>
<p>
Note that besides observables proper, we also get a file (theta.vtk) with scalar field components in
polar form, which (by virtue of being only three) are much easier to visualize than four Cartesian 
components.
</p>
<p>
The files can now be visualized and processed further using standard tools like 
<a href="https://www.paraview.org/" target="_blank">ParaView</a>,
<a href="https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/" target="_blank">VisIt</a>, 
<a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a> and 
<a href="https://www.scipy.org/" target="_blank">SciPy</a>.
