<h1>evolve_1d</h1>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
Reads a <a href="http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Writing_VTK_files_using_python#.22legacy.22" target="_blank">legacy ASCII VTK</a> 
file containing a field configuration in one spatial dimension, evolves it in static 1+1D spacetime and saves snapshots of the 
evolving field configurations to new VTK files at regular simulated time intervals. Scalars are read and written in Cartesian 
field coordinates.
</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
   evolve_1d [<i>arguments</i>]
</p>

<h3>Arguments</h3>
<p>
All arguments are entered as a name (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen%E2%80%93minus" target="_blank">hyphen-minus</a> 
followed by a two-character combination) separated from the associated value by whitespace. An argument without a value is not 
allowed. If an argument is not provided on the command line, the default value shown below [between square brackets] is used:

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
Input (-if) and output filenames (-of) should require no explanation. The title (-ot) is just a string 
which ends up in the header of the output file, and might be useful for tagging it.
</p>
<p>
The roles of -dt (time step), -mt (max simulated time), -ms (max number of time steps), -sp (simulated 
time between sucessive snapshot files) and -rp (simulated time between reports to standard output) should 
also be clear. Note that -mt and -ms have overlapping functionality; one or the other may be more convenient, 
depending on circumstances.
</p>
<p>
<strong>WARNING:</strong> with the default -mt and -ms, the simulation will run until you 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_(command)" target="_blank">kill</a> it.
</p>
<p>
Lambda (-la) is essentially the strength of the constraint imposed on the scalars to keep their norm = 1. 
Ideally, it should be infinite. In practice, larger -la requires shorter time steps (-dt) to keep the 
jitters around the constraint surface from diverging, so there is a tradeoff between constraint quality and
runtime. The default value (1000) seems to be a good compromise for many cases of interest.
</p>
<p>
Epsilon (-eo) is essentially the largest acceptable relative change in any field value at any lattice site
between successive iterations of the non-linear solver at the core of the program's Störmer-Verlet integrator.
If this value is exceeded at any lattice site, the solver goes through another iteration for all lattice sites.
This continues until there is convergence or the maximum number of allowed iterations (-mi) is exceeded. In the 
latter case, cascading divergences are likely to ensue, along with rapid deviations from energy conservation,
and the simulation can no longer be trusted. Increasing -mi may help in some cases, but usually only a smaller
time step will.
</p>
<p>
The -eo and -mi arguments are only recognized and used when the program is compiled with the default Störmer-Verlet 
integrator. Euler and fourth order Runge-Kutta integrators are also implemented in the source code, and the program 
can be compiled to use those instead. Euler integration should not be considered for production runs, but may be
useful for pedagogical and testing purposes. Runge-Kutta integration might be competitive with Störmer-Verlet in
some cases.

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>
<dl>
   <dt class="example">evolve_1d</dt>
      <dd class="example">Use the defaults for all argument values. <strong>WARNING:</strong> This will cause the program 
                          to run until you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_(command)" target="_blank">kill</a> it.</dd>
   <dt class="example">evolve_1d -if two_cells -of evolved_two_cells</dt>
      <dd class="example">Read initial configuration from file "two_cells.vtk", write snapshots to files 
                          named "evolved_two_cells_N.vtk", where N is the simulation step number. Again, run until killed.</dd>
   <dt class="example">evolve_1d -mt 32 -sp 0.2 -rp 0.1</dt>
      <dd class="example">Run the simulation for 32 lattice time units, saving snapshot files every 0.2
                          and writing a report line to standard output every 0.1.</dd>
