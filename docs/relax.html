<h1>relax</h1>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
Reads a <a href="http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Writing_VTK_files_using_python#.22legacy.22" target="_blank">legacy ASCII VTK</a> 
file containing a field configuration in three spatial dimensions, reduces its static energy density by selective 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter" target="_blank">low pass filtering</a> and writes the resulting field 
configuration to a new VTK file. Scalars are read and written in polar field coordinates.
</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
   relax [<i>arguments</i>]
</p>

<h3>Arguments</h3>
<p>
All arguments are entered as a name (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen%E2%80%93minus" target="_blank">hyphen-minus</a> 
followed by a two-character combination) separated from the associated value by whitespace. An argument without a value is not 
allowed. If an argument is not provided on the command line, the default value shown below [between square brackets] is used:
</p>
<dl>
   <dt>-sf ["signal.txt"]</dt>
      <dd>Name of optional signal file, used to issue commands to running program.</dd>
   <dt>-if ["initial"]</dt>
      <dd>Name of input file. Do not use file extensions; ".vtk" is automatically appended.</dd>
   <dt>-of ["relaxed"]</dt>
      <dd>Name of output file. Do not use file extensions; ".vtk" is automatically appended.</dd>
   <dt>-ot ["Relaxed"]</dt>
      <dd>Title of output file. Ends up in the VTK header, can be any descriptive string.</dd>
   <dt>-ns [10]</dt>
      <dd>Number of low pass sweeps between convergence checks.</dd>
   <dt>-rr [1e-6]</dt>
      <dd>Minimum required relative improvement. If energy is reduced less between successive 
          convergence checks, the program terminates.</dd>
   <dt>-wt [1e-4]</dt>
      <dd>Central weight stepping threshold. When relative energy reduction between successive 
          convergence checks falls below this value, the weight of the central cell in the low 
          pass filter stencil is incremented by -ws.</dd>
   <dt>-ws [1e-2]</dt>
      <dd>Incremental step for weight of central cell in low pass filter stencil.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
Input (-if) and output filenames (-of) should require no explanation. The title (-ot) is just a string 
which ends up in the header of the output file, and might be useful for tagging it.
</p>
<p>
The optional signal file specified with -sf is expected to be a plain text file. If present, it is
read before each convergence check. The following commands are recognized:
<dl>
   <dt>abort</dt>
      <dd>Terminate execution immediately with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status#Unix" target="_blank">exit status</a> 1.</dd>
   <dt>quit</dt>
      <dd>Terminate execution immediately with exit status 0 (normal termination).</dd>
   <dt>save</dt>
      <dd>Save current field configuration.</dd>
   <dt>save N</dt>
      <dd>Save field configuration after N (an integer) low pass sweeps. Example: save 10000</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
The -ns, -rr, -wt and -ws arguments control the relaxation algorithm. On each sweep, the current 
energy density at each lattice site is compared with the energy densities obtained by low-pass 
filtering only the electromagnetic vector potential, only the scalar fields, and both (at that site 
only, i.e. without modifying the fields at other sites). The field values yielding the lowest energy 
density are stored in a new lattice. When the entire lattice has been processed, the two lattices are 
swapped ("ping-pong"). Every -ns sweeps, total energy is computed and compared with the previously 
computed value. If it's higher, or if the relative improvement is less than -rr, the program terminates.
Otherwise, if the relative improvement is less than -wt, the weight of the central cell in the low 
pass filter stencil is incremented by -ws.
</p>
<p>
The filter starts out with vanishing central weight, effectively replacing every site with an average 
of its neighbors, then gradually becomes less aggressive as the central weight is incremented, "polishing" 
field values until there is no further significant improvement. Performing multiple sweeps between total 
energy comparisons speeds up execution, but can cause the best result to be missed. Reducing -ns, -ws, -wt 
and -rr (in that order) may produce better results, but keep in mind that relax is primarily meant as a 
preprocessor for <a href="optimize.html">optimize</a>.
</p>
<p>
All momenta are ignored. Only static energy is minimized. Periodic boundary conditions (i.e. toroidal lattice
topology) are used.
