<h1>seed_1d</h1>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
Creates a <a href="http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Writing_VTK_files_using_python#.22legacy.22" target="_blank">legacy ASCII VTK</a> 
file containing a randomly seeded, static field configuration in one spatial dimension. Scalars are in polar field coordinates.
</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
   seed_1d [<i>arguments</i>]
</p>

<h3>Arguments</h3>
<p>
All arguments are entered as a name (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen%E2%80%93minus" target="_blank">hyphen-minus</a> 
followed by a two-character combination) separated from the associated value by whitespace. An argument without a value is not 
allowed. If an argument is not provided on the command line, the default value shown below [between square brackets] is used:

   <dt>-of ["initial"]</dt>
      <dd>Name of output file. Do not use file extensions; ".vtk" is automatically appended.</dd>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
Filename (-of) and number of lattice sites (-dt) should require no explanation. The title (-ot) is just a string which 
ends up in the header of the output file, and might be useful for tagging it. The ability to specify a random seed
makes it possible to recreate an initial configuration, provided that the same executable is used again on the same 
system (do not expect the same random seed to produce the same result with an executable created using a different 
compiler or math library).
</p>
<p>
Operating mode (-om) determines the kind of configuration to be created. The default is Voronoi cells, which
in 1D simply means sequences of constant field values separated by interpolating transition layers (boundaries). 
In this mode, the number of control points (-nc) is the number of cells and boundary width (-bw) is the number of 
lattice sites in each interpolation layer. For pulses (-om 1), the configuration is a set of isolated bumps on a 
constant (zero) background, in which case -nc sets the number of bumps and -bw sets their half width (distance 
from peak to onset of constant background).
</p>
<p>
In "periodic" operating mode (-om 2), the entire configuration is a transition layer, smoothly interpolating between the 
field values at the center of the lattice and its borders, optionally more than once (-nx). In this mode, the -nc and -bw 
parameters are ignored. You could argue that -nx is redundant; -nc could convey the same information in this case. But this
would not carry over to 3D, where we also need -ny and -nz parameters.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the A factor (-af) multiplies the randomly generated electromagnetic vector potential, and can be used to obtain 
a desired mix of initial magnetic versus scalar field energy. For pure NLSM, i.e. no electromagnetism, use -af 0.
</p>
<p>
All momenta are set to 0. Since the time-axial gauge is used, this implies vanishing electric fields and charge densities.
